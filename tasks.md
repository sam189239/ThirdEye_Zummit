 Current progress:

TTS based alert system
Modified warning system by detecting obstacle state
Limited alert counts
Set up alert system for live demo

9/1/22

 warning through file handling

10/1/22
 tested new client video
 reduced warning averaging
 good results on warning algo
 set up alerting through 3d sound

upto 18/1/22
